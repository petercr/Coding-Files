__ Hellow World!! __

  After many years away from writing code, I have once again found my love for coding. I stumbled across an app in the Google Play Store that had some lessions on coding in a few different launguages. I did graduate from Cape Cod Community College in 2010 with an Associates Degree in Information Technology. I never really got to put it to use though, as I go sick with cancer for a second time shortly after. And while it's been quite a few years since then, I still haven't fully recovered. I took CS101 and CS201 with Java in college and loved it. I also took a couple of Visual Basic classes too which were great fun! Hopefully I can transition into some-type of developer roll in the future. But until then at least I can still code some webpages. :smiley::+1:
